homage: $HOME is where the tilde
==========================

Welcome to *homage*  -- the clever title I picked for my dotfiles repo. It contains a bunch of dotfiles -- that is to say:

* my `.bash_profile` and a directory full of offshoot `bash` stuff -- all of that which gets loaded into my interactive shell processes. Some of the offshoots are more purpose-built, module-y function suites; of these, some I wrote, some I did not, it’s like fifty-fifty I feel like.
* Python REPL configuration stuff and default repl-environment imports; of late I have been slouching towards unifying this shit and making it not insane to work with. Pretty much all of that is in the `.script-bin` directory (which does double-duty as a Python junk-drawer module) except in cases where some file needs to be in some other stupid place, like to meet the whims of some REPL module or whatever.
* Miscellaneous config files for lots of CLI utilities and suchlike. Likely of seriously limitied interest to most everyone on earth besides me; some exceptions may prove to be the `bpython` configuration files (the only REPL configs I know of and/or make use of that aren’t extremely arcane and underdocumented Python modules themselves) and maybe `direnvrc`.

… there is other shit in there as well (emphasis on _shit_, really) which I will document if I should find myself serendipidously enthused by any of it in some later future fuckings-about, yes. Indeed!
