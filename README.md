homage: $HOME is where the tilde
==========================

Welcome to *homage*  -- the clever title I picked for my dotfiles repo. It contains a bunch of dotfiles -- that is to say:

* [My `.bash_profile` file](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_profile), and [a directory full of offshoot `bash` stuff](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/tree/master/.bash_config.d) -- all of that which gets loaded into my interactive shell processes. Some of the offshoots are more purpose-built, module-y function suites; of these, [some](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_config.d/url_download.sh) [I wrote](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_config.d/url_cache.sh), [some](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_config.d/bash_prompt.sh) [I did](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_config.d/git_prompt.sh) [not](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.bash_config.d/git_completion.sh), it’s like fifty-fifty I feel like.
* [Python REPL configuration stuff](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.script-bin/replenv.py) and [default REPL-environment imports](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.script-bin/replutilities.py); of late I have been slouching towards unifying this shit and making it not insane to work with. Pretty much all of that is in [the `.script-bin` directory](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/tree/master/.script-bin) (which does double-duty as a Python junk-drawer module) except in cases where some file needs to be [in some other stupid place, like to meet the whims of some REPL module](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/tree/master/.ptpython) or whatever.
* Miscellaneous config files for lots of CLI utilities and suchlike. Likely of seriously limitied interest to most everyone on earth besides me; some possible exceptions could possibly be [the `bpython` configuration files](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/tree/master/.config/bpython) (the only REPL configs I know of and/or make use of that aren’t [extremely arcane](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.ptpython/config.py) [and/or underdocumented Python modules](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py) themselves) and maybe [`direnvrc`](https://github.com/fish2000/homage/blob/master/.config/direnv/direnvrc).

… there is other shit in there as well (emphasis on _shit_, really) which I will document if I should find myself serendipidously enthused by any of it in some later future fuckings-about, yes. Indeed!
